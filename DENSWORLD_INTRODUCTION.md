# Introduction to Densworld
## A Guide to the Fantasy World Behind the Data

---

*"Every true journey begins in Yeller Quarry. It drives straight through the Capital to Mirado, pushing hard to take the tower in the desert with an implacable force of will."*

## What Is Densworld?

Densworld is a fictional fantasy universe of approximately 70,000 lines of narrative text, containing towns, creatures, scholars, trappers, expeditions, sieges, and strange phenomena. It was created as the foundation for data science and machine learning courses—a world rich enough to generate structured datasets that feel real but exist nowhere else.

You'll learn technical skills by analyzing data from this world: creature catalogs, manuscript archives, expedition logs, trap deployment records, and more. The fiction gives the data meaning. The data teaches real skills.

This guide introduces the geography, history, and key features of Densworld—everything you need to understand before diving into the courses.

## The Major Regions

Densworld contains several distinct regions, each with its own character, economy, and mysteries. Think of them arranged roughly like this:

```
                    THE NORTH
                        |
                        |
    NORTHO -------- HEESHOK -------- (COAST)
        \             |
         \            |
          NORTH TOWN  |
              \       |
               \      |
            YELLER QUARRY
                  |
                  |
    DEAD RIVER ---+--- THE CAPITAL --- CAPEAST
                  |        |
                  |        |
                DENS ------|------ (DESERT)
                           |
                      MIRADO STICKS
                           |
                       (MIRADO)
```

### The Capital

**The center of civilization.** The Capital is where archivists maintain records, senators debate policy, and expeditions are funded. It is the most sophisticated city in Densworld, with paved roads, libraries, government buildings, and an economy based on knowledge.

The Capital Archives are legendary—vast repositories of manuscripts, creature catalogs, expedition reports, and scholarly debates. Archivists spend their entire careers there, organizing and studying the world's accumulated knowledge.

The Capital is also where theories about Densworld originate. Scholars here debate the nature of the Dens, the origin of strange creatures, and whether the Tower of Mirado can ever be taken.

**Key features:**
- The Archives (vast record-keeping institution)
- The Senate (political body that funds expeditions)
- Archivist shops (smaller private collections)
- Universities and lecture halls

### Yeller Quarry

**A dangerous extraction zone.** Yeller Quarry is a massive area of tunnels, marshes, and caves where trapping crews descend to capture creatures for sale to Capital merchants and archivists.

The technology is roughly Victorian—crews use handmade traps, torches, and rope. The creatures are decidedly not Victorian: Leatherback Burrowers with metal-rich hides, Maw Beasts that can take a man's face off, and stranger things that move in synchronized groups of prime numbers.

A legendary trapper known as **The Boss** designed most of the traps still in use. She disappeared during the Redmane Expedition.

**Key features:**
- Trapping crews (organized teams with specialties)
- Creature catalog (species with danger ratings, depths, behaviors)
- Stall towns (trade settlements on the Quarry's edges)
- The yeller phenomenon (creatures moving in primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

### The Dens

**A place of sludge and mystery.** The Dens is both a town and the wilderness surrounding it. In some stories, it's a regular (if dirty and remote) town on the edge of the western wilderness. In others, the town is bounded on all sides by a living sludge that heaps itself against the boundaries, threatening to swallow everything.

The Dens is the oldest thing in Densworld—or so the oldest theory claims. Nobody knows where this theory came from, and nobody can get rid of it.

The town was founded almost by accident: explorers stopped, an engineer bet he could build a house in the muck, and somehow the structure held. Others stayed, civilization rose, and now there are moats, towers, and a council that regulates everything.

**Key features:**
- The encroaching sludge ("Densmuck," "Goohldens")
- The moat (boundary between town and wilderness)
- Scavengers (those who live in the hills around the town)
- The boundary negotiations (where does Dens end and wilderness begin?)

### The Tower of Mirado

**A legendary city in the desert.** Mirado is a massive stone tower rising from desert sands, with a spiraling street lined with houses under a bluish haze at its top. Like a town under a space helmet.

Nobody knows who built it or when. Stories tell of seventy pools of purified water, seventy gradations of purity flowing through pipes that hold the city up. The tower has been under siege for generations—perhaps centuries. The Colonel has spent decades trying to take it.

The siege is interminable. No messages of defiance or surrender ever emerge. No one scales the massive pipes. Mirado simply waits.

**Key features:**
- The spiraling streets at the summit
- The seventy pools of purified water
- The Colonel's endless siege
- Lieutenant Fincho (the Colonel's faithful second)

### Mirado Sticks

**A settlement in the tower's shadow.** Mirado Sticks is a town you can see the tower from—a place where people live ordinary lives while a legendary siege unfolds in the distance.

The name "Mirado" is given to children born here, girls and boys alike. One woman named Mirado tends her garden while lieutenants search for their lost colonel.

**Key features:**
- View of the distant tower
- Ordinary life against extraordinary backdrop
- The ditch between three shacks (Tarpon, Mirado, and another)

### Northo

**The religious heartland.** Northo is a region of churches, prayer, and faith—and also doubt. Religious communities argue about God, ascetics withdraw to isolated villages, and wanderers search for meaning.

The people here take tossing stones after conversations seriously, so as not to "lose any words in the exchange."

**Key features:**
- Churches and religious communities
- Feuding church signs
- Prayer practices and rituals
- The tension between belief and doubt

### North Town

**A border region of warnings.** North Town sits between Northo and Yeller Quarry. Children are warned about dangers. Secrets are kept.

**Key features:**
- Border location
- Warnings about the Quarry
- Family secrets

### Dead River

**A place that may not exist.** The town of Dead River "had nor river nor whores nor sheriff nor church. No church because no river for waters of baptism." Maps name it, but travelers who find the marked location discover only scrub brush and dust.

Dead River is a place of structure without meaning—form that points to something that isn't there.

**Key features:**
- Named on maps, absent on the ground
- The question of what makes a place real
- Journeys that lead to emptiness

### Capeast

**East of the Capital.** A region with its own festivals, prayers, and connections to Northo. Post-steel economy with experience futures markets.

**Key features:**
- Festival culture
- Economic experiments
- Connections to other regions

### Heeshok

**A northern town.** Mentioned in connection with the north roads and the Capital's reach.

## Key Characters

### The Colonel

A military leader who has spent decades—perhaps his entire adult life—laying siege to Mirado. He was a boy when the siege started. Now he's a grandfather, tired, wondering if any of it matters. His daughter has wandered off. Word has reached him of a grandchild somewhere.

The Colonel spends his days in camp, toying with "amateur distractions" (books, diagrams, pictures of gargoyles or jaguars). His lieutenant Fincho has been with him for twenty or thirty years.

### Fincho (Lieutenant)

The Colonel's faithful second-in-command. He follows the Colonel not from ambition but from a kind of loyalty that has become his life's anchor. When the Colonel disappears on one of his wanderings, Fincho cannot last more than a week before gathering the men to search.

### The Boss

A legendary trapper from Yeller Quarry who designed most of the traps still in use. She was practical, ugly in her methods, but effective. She disappeared during the Redmane Expedition in March 1855. Her body was never recovered.

### Grigsu Haldo

A scholar of sorts, a "third-rate scholar and archivist" who became obsessed with a creature called Yeller. He wandered from Dens to Dead River to the Quarry, following Yeller wherever they could be found. He was a chatterer, constantly talking, living night after night as a solitary straining to hear speech.

Grigsu died in a backwater village after returning from an expedition into Yeller Quarry, changed—sullen and angry where he had once been cheerful.

### Bagbu / Vagabu Olt

A wandering mapmaker and sketch-artist who travels in a "pickbox cart" filled with papers, ideas, maps, and diagrams. He knew Grigsu, Yasho, and other thinkers in the Capital. He is the narrator of some key stories, always rumbling from one town to another, seeking something just over the next ridge.

### Yeller (The Creature/Women)

A mysterious entity—sometimes described as a single creature, sometimes as a group of five women who move together. "Only one of Yeller's kind has been found anywhere." The search for others continues.

The "yeller phenomenon" in the Quarry may be connected: creatures moving in synchronized groups of prime numbers.

### The Mapmaker / The Preacher

A figure who appears in various ore fragments—sometimes a mapmaker who isn't a preacher, sometimes a preacher who makes maps. He wanders with strange machines of bone and leather, captures people, tells stories of fights and rituals.

### Chief Archivist Mink

Runs the records division in the Capital Archives. Appears in the Yeller Quarry courses as the figure who oversees apprentice archivists.

---

## Key Phenomena

### The Yeller Numbers

Throughout Densworld, the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 appear with suspicious frequency. Creatures move in groups of primes. Catches come in prime quantities. Disappearances follow prime intervals.

Nobody knows why.

### The Sludge / Densmuck

The wilderness around Dens is not static ground but living muck that advances and retreats. The town's moat is a constant negotiation with the encroaching ooze.

### Shifting Boundaries

Where does one place end and another begin? This question haunts Densworld. The boundary between Dens and wilderness shifts. The tower of Mirado seems to exist somewhere between reality and legend. Maps name places that aren't there.

### The Interminable Siege

The siege of Mirado has lasted so long that nobody remembers when it started or what would count as an end. It is the pursuit of something that may not exist in the form people imagine.

---

## The Journeys

Densworld is structured around journeys—physical and metaphorical:

1. **Yeller Quarry to Mirado**: The archetypal journey. It begins with will and feeling (the Quarry), passes through civilization and knowledge (the Capital), and ends in an interminable pursuit of the unattainable (Mirado).

2. **The Journey to the North**: A final journey of destruction or forgetting. The North represents negation—either ascetic isolation or the creation of blank space.

3. **The Wanderer's Circuit**: Characters like Bagbu travel endlessly between regions, never quite settling, never quite finding what they're looking for.

## How to Read Densworld

Densworld is not meant to be understood all at once. It exists in fragments—stories that overlap, contradict, and complicate each other.

When you take a course, you'll encounter one slice of this world: the Quarry's creature data, the Capital's manuscript archives, the siege of Mirado as a metaphor for gradient descent. Each course illuminates part of the whole.

The data you analyze will be consistent and structured. The fiction it comes from is messier, stranger, more like dreams than histories.

That's by design.

## What You Don't Need to Know

You don't need to memorize any of this before starting a course. Each course provides the context you need. The creatures will be explained when you analyze them. The characters will be introduced when they matter.

This guide exists for when you're curious—when you finish a tutorial and wonder what else is out there, or when a name appears and you want to know who that is.

The world is here whenever you're ready to explore it.

*"The road itself whispers nothing but what's nearest along it. Roadsigns are charlatans. Maps, mere soothsayers. The road is its own four feet at a time."*
