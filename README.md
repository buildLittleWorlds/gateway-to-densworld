# Gateway to Densworld
## Learning Colab Through Fiction

---

Welcome to Densworld—a collection of data science and machine learning courses built on a 70,000-line fictional universe.

This gateway course introduces two things simultaneously:
1. **Google Colab**: How to use Jupyter notebooks (from absolute beginner to confident practitioner)
2. **Densworld**: The fantasy world whose data you'll be analyzing in all subsequent courses

Each tutorial teaches a technical skill BY exploring a region of the world. You emerge both competent and oriented.

## What Is Densworld?

Densworld is a fictional fantasy universe containing towns, creatures, scholars, trappers, expeditions, sieges, and strange phenomena. It was created as the foundation for data science courses—a world rich enough to generate structured datasets that feel real but exist nowhere else.

**Why fiction?**
- You can't copy answers from the internet (nobody else has analyzed Yeller Quarry trap records)
- Stories make concepts memorable
- Domain knowledge matters—you'll learn to understand *this* data
- Learning should be interesting

## The World at a Glance

| Region | Character | What Happens There |

| **The Capital** | Civilization, knowledge | Archivists maintain records, scholars debate |
| **Yeller Quarry** | Danger, extraction | Trapping crews capture strange creatures |
| **The Dens** | Mystery, dissolution | Shifting sludge threatens to swallow everything |
| **Tower of Mirado** | Legend, pursuit | A siege that has lasted for decades |
| **Northo** | Faith, doubt | Religious communities wrestle with belief |
| **Dead River** | Absence | A place named on maps but absent on the ground |
